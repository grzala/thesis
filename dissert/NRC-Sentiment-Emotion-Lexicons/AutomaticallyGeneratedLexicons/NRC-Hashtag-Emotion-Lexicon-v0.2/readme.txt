************************************************************
GENERAL DESCRIPTION
************************************************************

The NRC Hashtag Emotion Lexicon is a list of words and their associations with eight emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust). The associations were computed from tweets with emotion-word hashtags such as #happy and #anger. 

The NRC Hashtag Emotion Lexicon is different from the NRC Emotion Lexicon. The Hashtag lexicon was automatically generated from tweets using emotion word hashtags. The NRC Emotion Lexicon was created by crowdsourcing and direct human annotation. 


************************************************************
DATA SOURCE
************************************************************

The NRC Hashtag Emotion Lexicon is automatically generated from the following data source: 
tweets with emotion-word hashtags collected by NRC.


************************************************************
FILE FORMAT
************************************************************

Each line has the following format:
<AffectCategory><tab><term><tab><score>

<AffectCategory> is one of eight emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, or disgust).

<term> is a word for which emotion associations are provided.

<score> is a value that indicates the strength of association between the <term> and the <AffectCategory>. The higher the value, the stronger is the association. Refer to the publications below for details on how the score is calculated.


************************************************************
VERSION INFORMATION
************************************************************

Version 0.2 is the latest version as of 4 November 2013. Version 0.1 was created using eight hashtags (pertaining to the eight basic emotions). Version 0.2 was created using 72 hashtags (these include the eight used in version 0.1 as well as their synonyms.) The publications mentioned below describe the creation and use of version 0.1.
