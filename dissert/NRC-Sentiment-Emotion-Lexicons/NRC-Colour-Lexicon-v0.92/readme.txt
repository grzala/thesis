************************************************************
GENERAL DESCRIPTION
************************************************************

Many real-world concepts have associations with colours. For example, iceberg is associated with white, vegetation with green, danger with red, and so on. The NRC word-colour association lexicon is a list of
words and the colours they are most associated with. The annotations were manually done through Amazon's Mechanical Turk. 



************************************************************
FILE FORMAT
************************************************************

Each line has the following format:
<TargetWord>--<sense><tab>Colour=<colour><tab>VotesForThisColour=<VotesForThisColour><tab>TotalVotesCast=<TotalVotesCast>

<TargetWord> is a word for which the annotators provided colour associations;

<sense> is one or more comma-separated words that indicate the sense of the target word for which the annotations are provided;

<colour> is the colour most associated with the target word. It is one of eleven colours---white, black, red, green, yellow, blue, brown, pink, purple, orange, grey. If each of the annotators suggested a different colour association for the target word, then <colour> is set to None.

<VotesForThisColour> is the number of annotators who chose <colour> for the target word. It is set to None if <colour> is None.

<TotalVotesCast> is the total number of annotators who gave colour associations for the target word.
