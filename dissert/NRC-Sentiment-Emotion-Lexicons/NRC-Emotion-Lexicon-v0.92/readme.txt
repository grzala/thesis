************************************************************
GENERAL DESCRIPTION
************************************************************

The NRC Emotion Lexicon is a list of words and their associations with eight emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust) and two sentiments (negative and positive). The annotations were manually done through Amazon's Mechanical Turk. 



************************************************************
FORMS OF THE LEXICON
************************************************************

1. Annotations at word-sense level (file: NRC-Emotion-Lexicon-Senselevel-v0.92.txt)

The original lexicon has annotations at word-sense level. Each word-sense pair was annotated by at least three annotators (most are annotated by at least five). 

2. Annotations at word level (file: NRC-Emotion-Lexicon-Wordlevel-v0.92.txt)

The word-level lexicon was created by taking the union of emotions associated with all the senses of a word. 

3. Translation into 105 languages (file: NRC-Emotion-Lexicon-v0.92-In105Languages-Nov2017Translations.xlsx)

The NRC Emotion Lexicon has affect annotations for English words. Despite some cultural differences, it has been shown that a majority of affective norms are stable across languages. Thus, we provide versions of the lexicon in 105 languages by translating the English terms using Google Translate (November 2017).  

Note that some translations by Google Translate may be incorrect or they may simply be transliterations of the original English terms. 



************************************************************
FILE FORMAT 
************************************************************

Annotations at WORD-SENSE LEVEL (file: NRC-Emotion-Lexicon-Senselevel-v0.92.txt)

Each line has the following format:
<term>--<NearSynonyms><tab><AffectCategory><tab><AssociationFlag>

<term> is a word for which emotion associations are provided;

<NearSynonyms> is a set of one to three comma-separated words that indicate the sense of the <term>. The affect annotations are for this sense of the term.

<AffectCategory> is one of eight emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, or disgust) or one of two polarities (negative or positive);

<AssociationFlag> has one of two possible values: 0 or 1. 0 indicates that the target word has no association with affect category, whereas 1 indicates an association.
