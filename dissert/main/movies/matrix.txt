					AGENT SMITH
			I hate this place.  This zoo.
			This prison.  This reality,
			whatever you want to call it, I
			can't stand it any longer.  

					AGENT SMITH
			It's the smell, if there is such a
			thing.  I feel saturated by it.  I
			can taste your stink and every
			time I do, I fear that I've
			somehow been infected by it.


					AGENT SMITH
			Repulsive, isn't it?

					AGENT SMITH2
			I must get out of here, I must get
			free.  In this mind is tlie key.
			My key.
