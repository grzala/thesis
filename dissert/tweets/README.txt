List of files 

Data Format Summary 
The tweets are automatically labeled with the following seven emotions: anger, fear, joy, love, sadness, surprise and thankfulness. Each of the file has the following format:
tweetId	<tab> emotionLabel

In feature combination experiment, we used train_1.txt (248,898) for training and test.txt (250,000) for testing.
In examing the effects of increasing the sizes of training data, we used train_2_1.txt (1,000), train_2_2.txt (10,000), … , train_2_10.txt for training and the same test.txt (250,000) for testing.
Apart from the above-mentioned files, dev.txt was used as a development dataset.

FAQ

Q: Why do you share Twitter id only? Why not share Twitter text too?
A: Twitter has made very specific restrictions on redistributing Twitter data (Refer to 1.4.a in https://dev.twitter.com/terms/api-terms). We'd love to share Twitter text, but this is forbidden by Twitter. And the best we can do is to share Twitter ids. Similar cases happened in the past: 
"Twitter Asks DiscoverText to Stop Sharing Tweet Data"

"As per request from Twitter the data is no longer available."

Q: How can I get Twitter text by Twitter id?
A: Twitter has a special API (https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/statuses/show/%3Aid), which returns a tweet based on the Twitter id.    We recommend you to use Twitter4j (http://twitter4j.org/) API to collect tweets (https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/twitter4j/oJhFpK4CDsE%5B1-25%5D).
