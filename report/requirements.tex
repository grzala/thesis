\chapter{Requirements Specification\label{chap:requirements}}

\noindent This section describes functional and non-functional requirements of the proposed software.


\section{Functional Requirements}

\noindent {\bf FR1 Analysis of a semi structure script}

\noindent The software takes a semi structured script as input. The structure of a script must resemble a structure of a movie script. The script provides 3 kinds of information - characters involved in a scene, dialogue lines and actions performed by characters during the scenes. The software must be able to extract actions and emotions from the script.

\bigskip

\noindent {\bf FR2 Find relevant animation clip}

\noindent The software must take information about character's emotions and actions and choose animation clip that best represent's characters behaviour.

\bigskip

\noindent {\bf FR3 Assemble final scene}

\noindent The software takes information generated by other modules and outputs an animated scene. The outputted scene must be fully editable, enabling various adjustments before rendering.


\section{Non-Functional Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
\item The user should be able to use the software with a custom motion-capture database (Usability).
\item The user should be able to assign differenct character models to different characters (Usability).
\item The user should be able to fully customize and edit the final scene (Usability).
\item The software is designed to automatically create big amounts of animated scenes. The time of generating a scene is not a high priority, but it must be reasonable (Peformance).
\item The software must support common animation file formats (fbx, bvh) (Portability).
\end{itemize}
