\chapter{Testing and Performance \label{chap:testingperf}}

This section describes testing and potential issues of the developed software.

\section{Animation Generator}
There are some serious limitations to testing of this module. It is hard for a computer to decide whether the animation looks natural. Some animations imported from EMDB experience import problems which results in an animation with broken and unnatural movements. While manually analysing the emotional values of the animations, it was important to check each animations for movements that may have been incorrectly imported. Such animations cannot be used with the software.

The animation generator is now able to handle only up to two characters in the scene (although the module was designed with extensibility in mind). If a scene JSON file contains information on more than two characters (or no characters at all) the scene will not be assembled and an error message will be displayed instead. In case the scene file is corrupted and cannot be parsed the user will also be presented with an error message.

\section{Performance}
One of the important requirements of the software was the speed of execution. For creating an animation consisting of 6 dialogue lines using the first module takes up to 18 seconds. The matcher module is so quick that it's execution does not influence the total execution time. The generator module takes another four seconds on average. This results in an execution speed of about 3.6 seconds per dialogue line. This fulfils the requirement as the time required to assemble an animation is incomparably less than doing that manually and is not a limitation for an animator working on the scene.
