The main focus are of this project is the usage of NLP for generating animated sequences. While this project puts particular emphasis on generating scenes of dialogue, there exist a multitude of projects that explores the usage of NLP in animation in a variety of ways.

\section{Generating Animated Scenes for Training and Instructions}
A very early research (1991) explores usage of NLP for creating animations that would help engineers demonstrate tasks in an easy and safe way (demonstrating tasks personally might be unsafe, reading manuals might be insufficient to understand the task in full)~\cite{animosha}. The system would take as input a set of natural language \textit{directives} or \textit{commands} (e.g. \textit{move cup to table}). The system would interpret such an instruction into a series of steps (tasks) that are carried out in a given order. Based upon that sequence an animation would be generated.

The project hovewer seems to have a few significant problems. Most importantly, the end results was not editable. In my research I believe that the end results will not be immediately satisfactory without any manual improvements and I believe that the outputted scenes should be fully editable. The other issue with this project is that the end result is not realistic or immersive (this was not a priority of that research, but is important for me). The animations were automatically generated in full, which I do not believe to be a viable approach for my project. To improve realism of the scenes, the animation should be created using motion capture clips.

\section{Animation From Text and Motion Database Framework}
This research project explores a topic much closer to mine. It does not put any emphasis on emotions or gestures (just actions), however it proposes a usage of motion capture database ~\cite{animmc}.
