\begin{abstract}
  Modern video games (especially those of the RPG genre) can feature over a hundred hours of dialogue. During a dialogue scene the characters are expected to behave naturally and use body language in a way that is `normal' and corresponds to what they are saying. Due to the sheer amount of dialogue animation needed it is impossible to animate all the scenes manually. Many solutions to automatic generation of such scenes (most of which are not available publicly and produce animations that still require a fair amount of manual work) have been tried with mixed results.
  
  This project aimed to develop a tool capable of generating 3D animated dialogue scenes with virtually no manual labour required. This is achieved by using natural language processing to extract the mood of characters directly from script and using a database of pre-recorded motion capture animations to assemble a dialogue scene. Additionally, the tool was aimed to be cross-platform, easy and cost-efficient to use, as such a tool would be most useful for small teams and amateur developers.
  
  The tool was evaluated by a real audience whose task was to compare scenes from actual games with scenes generated by the developed software. The tool succeeded in creating rather convincing animation that was often described as more enjoyable or engaging than the animations from games; Unfortunately the generated scenes lacked realism and the NLP approach was not accurate enough when dealing with sarcasm or ambiguity. Because of those issues the project did not achieve a full success.
  
  The software itself would need some serious improvements before becoming commercially viable. It is however developed enough to prove the usefulness of NLP in game animation. This approach has a potential to be incorporated into a larger animation generation framework (where other approaches besides NLP collaborate to create the most lifelike animations) and even to be extended into other areas of computing science such as robotics.

  First and foremost I would like to thank Professor Ehud Reiter for his invaluable guidance, supervision and patience. 

  Secondly, I would like to thank the Blender Foundation for providing free, open-source, modern 3D content creation tools for over 15 years and the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics for making the Emotional Body Motion Database available publicly.
  
  I would also like to thank the BioWare Montreal studio for developing \textit{Mass Effect: Andromeda}. The game famously suffered from multiple issues in many areas of game development. Its weird and unnatural dialogue animation constantly broke the player's immersion and turned serious moments into comedic scenes. The following blank-verse poem commemorates the achievements, the failure and the disbandment of the BioWare Montreal studio:

	  It seems like we hardly knew you,\newline
	  probably because you only existed for nine years and were relatively small\newline
	  The more surprising is the fact that\newline
	  you have been put in charge of the most significant of BioWare's franchises\newline
	  \newline
	  Pity,\newline
	  because you looked like a pretty cool place to work at\newline
	  Even though Glassdoor reviewers complained that there are no windows at the office\newline
	  and that they all feel like nocturnal creatures.\newline
	  Montreal also seems like a good place to live I guess\newline
	  despite all the snow in the winter and the roadwork in the summer\newline
	  But how would I know, I have never been to Canada anyway\newline
	  \newline
	  You should have went gently into that good night\newline
	  But you didn't\newline
	  And now your game is a laughing stock for the entire gaming community\newline
	  Press F to pay respects\newline
