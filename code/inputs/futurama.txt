					BENDER
			I'm tired of your yapping.  All you 
			ever do is complain, you never try to 
			make things better. 

					BENDER
			Well I'm running away from this dead end family! I know 
			there's a place for people like me with 
			new ideas. There has to be!
 
               
					FARNSWORTH
			Fine, get going!
            
					BENDER
			Oh I'm going! You're gonna be all "Where's 
			Bender? I miss Bender!"


					FARNSWORTH
			We won't know that until you leave.


					BENDER
			Oh, I'm leaving!
