			Son... You've saved me. I was afraid I'd be trapped in here forever.

					DAD
			It's so good to see you, but... what are you DOING here?

					SON
			I came here to find you.

					DAD
			Well I'm glad you did. This certainly wasn't how I expected thins to turn out.

					SON
			Good thing I showed up to save you.

					DAD
			It certainly is! It's nice to feel like I'm on two legs again.
