					AMARI
			How do you feel?

					ISAAC
			I'm okay, doctor. Thank you.

					AMARI
			That's good, but I want you to keep monitoring yourself. We have to be sure there's
			no long-term damage.

					AMARI
			Are you ready to talk about what happened in there?

					ISAAC
			I saw Kellog's life. The man who ruined my family. The man I killed.

					AMARI
			That's right. He was a human being just like the rest of us, and he had
			reasons for being what he was, however cruel.

					AMARI
			How does that make you feel?

					ISAAC
			It wasn't all his fault. I cannot blame him for everything that happened.

					AMARI
			If I were a priest, I would say forgiveness is a good thing.
